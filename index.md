My name is Kris, I am a machine learning engineer based in Amsterdam.

Late 2019 I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Currently I'm a machine learning engineer / artificial intelligence expert at [Clockworks Data Innovation](https://www.clockworks.co), where I build practical business solutions using the latest deep learning and computer vision techniques.
